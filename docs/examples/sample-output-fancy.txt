thesis: The drama is a thought experiment about changing the educational system when it doesn’t seem possible. At surface level, the conclusion of the drama seems like as happy of an ending as one could envision, with some kids in the castle ended up in alternate education and their families undergone a change in mindset about prestigious education. 

However, the characters that suffer any real moral consequence are those that were borne out of the working class. 
In effect, the drama’s conflicts and result to this struggle (conclusion) upholds the SK education system despite attempts to disturb it, leading to little change while eliminating the power of characters borne out of the working class that caused anxiety.

Just as people “nod along” to the beats of a song, this acts a sort of backtrack to the flow of travel + flow of game
“Csikszentmihalyi’s book on the subject was published in 1990, but a definition for the phe- nomenon is often cribbed from a 1996 Wired interview: “Being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz. Your whole being is involved, and you’re using your skills to the utmost.”1 In musical terms, flow means being in the groove; in athletic terms, we call it being in the zone. Flow is a state of being, one in which a task’s difficulty is perfectly balanced against a performer’s skill, resulting in a feeling of intense, focused attention.”
